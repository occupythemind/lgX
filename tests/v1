ISSUE:
	IDOR found on nested-url: /topics/{pk}/entries

	A user can "create" entries on other users' topics by simplying sending a post request, replacing {pk} with the primary_key of that topic.

CODE:
	def perform_create(self, serializer):
        if self.kwargs.get('topic_pk', ''):
            serializer.save(topic=Topic.objects.get(pk=self.kwargs.get('topic_pk', '')))
        else:
            raise ValidationError('This endpoint does not appreciate POST requests, use /api/topics/{pk}/entries rather.')
            
OBSERVATION:
	No authentication was carried out there, therefore, any legitimate user could just "create" an entry with just the pk of the topic he targets.

-----
FIX:
	Authenticate before saving to the serializer.

CODE:
